What is the plan?
The repl is getting large and I don't want confusion.
It is best if we have a plan here so everyone types with the same objective.

(changed this to a text file since we really don't need a python file to chat in)

I am currently rebuilding the battle system because it was kind of messy, to make it easier to use.
(helper/battle.py, aka what shows when you press run)
we should also probably figure out our storyline before we do much else

new battle system *should* be working for both single and multi battles, turns out i had created a test bubble
that was messing the whole thing up, still dont know why.
