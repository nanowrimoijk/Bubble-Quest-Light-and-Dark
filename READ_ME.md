Welcome to Bubble Quest Light and Dark! This game is based off of Pokémon and there are a lot of similarities to it. We are trying to stray away from Pokémon and hopefuly create some non-Pokémon effects.
The storyline is far from complete and we are far from done with the project. If you want to join the team and help, please email us at one of the email addresses listed below.

We worked really hard on this project, and are constantly working to improve the game. We have around 2500 lines of code writen in this project.
