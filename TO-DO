TO DO:
-Change it so that you can't spend energy when you have 0/negative amounts of it. (was thinking that we maybe keep health loss when energy is spent, but make you lose like 1/2 to 3/4 of your current health -glace)
-check for bubble fainting when energy is used up (bubbles have negative hp because they took damage from both opponent and from having 0 energy)
-(tournament battles) inputing a higher number than you have bubbles, then pressing yes for what the opponent wants, will end the battle as a victory
